Project Overview  
This project utilizes clustering method K-means clustering and clustering algorithm Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform data analysis on ALS patient data.  

Installation and Setup:  
Codes and Resources Used:  
·      Editor: Jupyter Notebook  

·      Python Version: 3.9.13  

Python Packages Used:  

·      Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy.  

·      Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn  
  
·      Machine Learning: sklearn.  
  
Data:  
als_data.csv  

Results and Evaluation:  
The optimal number of clusters using K-means clustering was determined by projecting the Silhouette scores agains different number of cluster.
For the PCA transformed data, a plot was generated showing different clusters which are represented by a color assigned to a cluster.
